        <ShortDescription>Full-wave FDTD Electromagnetic solver (Evaluation)</ShortDescription>
        <Description>
          This is the evaluation version of the SEMBA FDTD Electromagnetic simulator having the following features. 
	     * Cluster working capabilites through MPI.
             * Multiple threads per processor through OpenMP.
	     * Closed/symmetric problems by means of PEC and PMC conditions.
             * Open problems by means of PML boundary conditions (CPML formulation) or by Mur ABCs.
             * Non-uniformly meshed domains by means of mesh-grading techniques.
	     * Conformal meshing.
             * Bulk lossless and lossy dielectrics.
	     * Materials with frequency dependent relative permittivity and/or permeability, with an arbitrary number of complex-conjugate pole-residue pairs.
	     * Bulk anisotropic lossless and lossy dielectrics.
	     * Equivalent models of multilayered skin-depth materials
	     * Cable bundles and harnesses: junctions of wires of different radii, Junctions of multiwires, Wire bundles, Loaded with p.u.l resistance and inductance wires, Grounding through lumped elements.
             * Plane wave illumination with arbitrary time variation.
	     * Hertztian dipole sources
	     * Equivalent Huygens surfaces
	     * Low frequency thin composites and lossy surfaces 
	     * Thin slots.
	     * Time, frequency and transfer function probes 
	     * Time animations in volumes through Paraview
	     * Near-to-far field transformation.
          The evaluation version has the following limitations:
             * No conformal meshing support.
             * Structured mesher limited to 1000 nodes.
             * FDTD solver limited to structured meshes, no sub-cell materials, and 64 MCells.
